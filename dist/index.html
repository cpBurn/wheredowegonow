      It seems you are very curious and impatient to what’s gonna happen<br/>
      As I said… trust me as you did 1 year ago on the first birthday I prepared for you.<br/>
      Funny, I just realised that when I started planning your last birthday, we were still just friends…<br/>
      </p>

      <p>Things changed huh?</p>

      <p>
      I remember talking to you that birthday is just a thing, you never really celebrated it<br/>
      But not for me… I’m a very happy person because 20 years ago you were born.<br/>
      And I told myself you should have a special birthday, because you are very special.<br/>
      </p>

      <p>
      It is a humble, but very honest gift I have.<br/>
      Rather than things I decided to give you something to breathe<br/>
      To see and remember<br/>
      </p>


      <p>Are you ready for a little adventure?</p>

      <p>
      Look at the nightstand on your side of the bed.<br/>
      Open the little door carefully and you will find something I bought for you..<br/>
      Inside, there’s a little something I wrote and more instructions.<br/>
      </p>

      <p>
      I love you a lot ;*
